 * suspends its compute after 5 minutes of inactivity; the first query after that wakes it back up,
 * which can take anywhere from a couple of seconds to ~20s — long enough that a customer landing
 * on the site mid-wake sometimes sees a timeout/error page. Keeping a query flowing at least every
 * 5 minutes means the site is basically never the one to trigger that wake-up. */
